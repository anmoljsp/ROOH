      <h3>Alumni Association</h3>
      <p>Alumni Association has been our backbone for the past year and has helped us hugely financially and has also provided its expertise in whichever way we required. The Alumini Association has provided us the perfect environment and resources to grow and help others grow as well. Due to their generous support, we were able to increase our students by 50% over the past year. <br>
      We are grateful to the member professors of the Alumni Association and all of the alumnus of NIT Kurukshetra for their unyweilding support.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Nivedita-Public-School" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Nivedita Public School</h3>
      <p>Our relation with Nivedita Public School goes back till the inception of this movement. They have been our pillar of strength and continue to be a part of our Rooh family. Through all of the late fee submissions to fee cuts and discounts, they have stood beside us and shown faith in us when nobody did.<br>
        We are honored at the support extended by the School Management and specially Principal, Nivedita Public School in our endeavour over the years.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Faculty-Members" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Faculty Members</h3>
      <p>In a marathon, it doesn't matter how you start, its about how you continue to keep track of your goals continously. We have been lucky to have several wise heads guiding us through the years and showing us the way to keep acheiving our goals while never compromising with our ideals.<br>
      The faculty members have not only guided us but have taken active part in all our initiatives over the year which has inspired more and more students to come out and support are causes. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="NIT-Admin" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>NIT Administration</h3>
      <p> Logistical support is of utmost importance for any event to not only be successful but to strike a cord with the people it is meant to connect with. We extend our Thanx to the NIT-KKR administration for providing all the necessary resources at all events that we organize smoothly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Students" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Students</h3>
      <p>The success of our movement can never be adjudged to be complete unless we hadn't had the support of the students of NIT-Kurukshetra. Our goals would have remained unfulfilled had the students didn't show their support through donations, through our shopping portal, Hoxgene, through buying our t-shirts or by being active part in our several social events and initiatives.<br>
        We continue to strive on the support offered by the student community of the college and would forever count on them to make our events successful.
