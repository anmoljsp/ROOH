      <h3>Sponsor A Child</h3>
      <p>Sponosor A Child is an initiative that we started with the objective of providing a medium to those who want to be a part of this movement and can be directly involved with the cause we work for. Under this program, any individual or a group of individuals can pledge to support the education of any children either partially or wholly each month. Its a program that not only enables you to support their education but also connect with these children intimately.<br>
Currently over a quarter of the students have been pledged for and the movement has just only started. You can check under the students section for all the students who have been sponsored and those who are yet to be accounted for. The monthly tution fee of these children are minimal and ranges from anywhere between 500 to 1300 ruppees depending on their standard due to the heavy concession afforded by the school of these children, Nivedita Public School.<br>
Several of the faculty members and alumnus of the college have stepped forward and helped with the funding of the education of several children. Many students have also come up and have done their bit. The donations may sometimes be as meagre as Rs.10 but it is the emotion that matters to us and not the face value.<br>
You can check the details of all the students in their section including their previous year's result. Each and every donation made, with respect to This initiative would be accompanied with a reciept in the name of Nivedita Public School, Thanesar. Any other donation made would be acknowledged with a slip in the name of Rooh society. To ensure transparency and your trust, details of each and every donation greater than Rs. 30 are updated on our Facebook page. Do like us for continually recieving information about our future endeavours.

    <div id="Blood-Donation-Camp" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Blood Donation Camp</h3>
      <p>Blood Donation Camp(BDC) is one of our main event that we conduct in each semester. A camp is organized in the campus twice a year to let willing donors, whether students, faculty members or non-teaching staff members, can donate blood. Over 200 units are collected regularly in these routine camps that are setup by the Red Cross teams. <br>
We have also created a Dynamic Blood Database where we have kept details of hundreds of blood donors so that if anyone is faced with a sudden need, no  time is wasted and his life can be saved. If you want to enroll yourself, please fill out this Google Form.<br>
Utmost preference is given to the safety and security of the donors with specialized doctors from the Red Cross teams conducting and supervising the operations. Used syringes are disposed off and bags are sealed and stored at ambient temperatures. A thorough check of each donor is conducted foremost to determine if he/she is able to donate or not.<br>
Food and milk is offered both before and after the donation and the donors are administered appropriate rest before letting them leave. We have also worked towards spreading awareness among those who are still apprehensive of the health affect it may have.<br>
Donating  blood saves up to 3 lives each time. Hundreds of people die in our country each day due to unavailability of correct blood groups. Several children with Thallasemia have to be given monthly blood units just to survive. Each time you  take up the doctor's table, you are secretly helping a soul continue it's journey.<br>
That's not to say that the benefits of blood donation is for others only. It has several benefits for the donor itself as well. It cleanses your blood and pure blood is present inside your body that decreases several health risks. Regular blood Donations help in lower risk of kidney stones and infections.</p>

    <div id="Hoxgene" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Hoxgene</h3>
      <p>Hoxgene is one of our newer initiative that allows you to contribute to our cause while shopping or like we call it, HELPING BY SHOPPING.<br>
We all are doing online shopping these days. Not only shopping, our payents have become digitzed and wallets ahve become mainstream. Hotels, flights, tickets and all yout travel itinery is decided online. The website is based on the concept of affiliate marketing where the e-commerce retailers pay you commisions for each item that is purchased through your link. So as a part of this initiative, a part of your online purchase will be sent to us by the retailer which dirctly goes towards donation. You can shop on any of your favorite website, do recharges or book hotels across leading companies across each domain & most importantly, still contribute towards this cause.<br>
Now the most important question. Do you have to pay more? Not a dime. All that you have to do is visit our dedicated website www.hoxgene.com and click on the link of the reatiler on whose site you have to order your product and you would be seemlessly redirected to the retailer's homepage.You can now continue with your normal searching and ordering of products and just checkout normally where you will be paying the same amount as you would have had you directly moved to the parent company's site. Depending on the type or category of the product, some percentage of that amount is channeled back to us by the retailer.<br>
Lets say I'm buying a shoe worth Rs.1199 from Flipkart, then you have to pay exactly Rs.1199, but Flipkart will give us some percentage of this 1199, which varies between 0.5% - 8% depending on the product, which directly funds the education of the children.<br>
Now we understand that it isn't viable to each time remember to go through our website and also it is a tab time consuming. Thus to make it even more efficient and easy for use, you don't even have to open hoxgene.com. We have also developed a Chrome Extension for Hoxgene which frees you from the chaos of  visiting hoxgene.com everytime. You just have to directly go to the online merchant's site and do your shopping, the affiliate link will automatically be added by the extention.<br>
In case you are wondering that most of your online shopping is through mobile apps so how can you be a part of this initiative? While we would encourage you to use browsers because they are the surest and the always correct method. But if you still want to go through the mobile apps, you can open hoxgene.com in your browsers, click on the link and you should be able to navigate back to the mobile app for your merchant, if it is supported by our servers.</p>

    <div id="Relief-Funds" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Relief Funds</h3>
      <p>The strngth of our values and beliefs are often tested and its the way we deal with them that defines us as one. While we have advanced and have contol of our lives, there are things that are beyond our control even now. Sometimes nature decides to test our resolve and our humanity. In those testing times, we must reach out to to our brothers who were unfortunate enough to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. We must help and thank god to be fortunate enough to be not present at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>
To show our support and do our bit in helping the lives of the sufferers come back on track, we collect money to donate in the Prime Minister's Relief Fund, whenever any large-scale natural calamity has occurred. In 2015, we donated around 5000Rs to the PMRF towards the Nepal Earthquake Relief and Rescue operations. We also contributed towards the Uttrakhand flash floods the same year that took a heavy toll on life and property.<br>
This year we are collecting funds for the Assam Floods that have rendered millions out of their homes with several thousands having lost their means of livelihood. While our help may seem insignificant in the wake of the billions of money that has been lost and the irrepayable loss of human life, we believe that the amount we are collecting can transform the life of atleast one family in a small manner.In case you want to donate for the Assam Floods you can click here.

    <div id="Make-A-Wish" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Make A Wish</h3>
      <p>Make A Wish is an event that is close to all our hearts. While our society started out with the sole objective of improving the academic facilities available to these children, who doesn't like her or his wish fulfilled once a while.<br>
Each year at Techspardha, the annual techno-managerial festival of NIT Kurukshetra, we collect the wishes of around a hundred students from economically poor backgrounds and setup a WISH WELL. The wishes can be fulfilled by anyone who wants to help either in cash or kind. You can either donate what the child wishes to have or if you are unable to get that object on your own, you can donate the amount to us and we will arrange for the item.<br>
While it may seem to be a too big ask to fulfill someone's wishes, these children aren't like us and value even small things in their lives heavily. Their wishes usuallly vary from a pencil to a box, from a bag to a badminton racqet, from a protactor to a compass; things which we don't even think about twice in our lives. But even these simple things are enough to put a smile to their faces and transform their lives.<br>
It certainly is an experience that makes us all introspect at the form of life we all are leading and these children are the prime examples of how we shall lead our life. While ambitions for future are necessary, contentment with the present is blissfull.</p>

    <div id="Swacch-Bharat-Abhiyaan" class="tab-pane fade">
      <h3>Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan</h3>
      <p>Swacch Bharat Abhiyaan is a Nation-wide cleaniness drive, a pilot project initiated by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India Shri Narendra Modi that strives to achieve nationwide cleaniness awareness and to make India a clean, green and waste free country by 2019, the 150th bithday of the Father of the Nation, Mahatama Gandhi. It includes now only cities but villages, rivers and all of the ecological environment as well.<br>
We at RooH have constantly felt the importance of cleaniness and even before the inception of these movement, we have been doing a lot of cleaniness drives in college campus with volunteers scavenging Market and Central Corridor Areas for waste which lead to hugely positive response and a highly cleaner campus within six months.<br>
We also closely monitored the states of the dustbins all over the campus, the ones that are broken, the ones that are overflowing or the ones that are poorly placed before the college authorities realized their job and took over the task of management of dustbins and regular cleaning on themselves.<br>
In conjunction with all the Cultural clubs, the RooH team took on the cleaning and beautification of Brahma Sarovar and its surrounding area under the Haryana Swacchta Board. We have also briefed the children to spread awareness in their homes and neighbourhood about the importance of cleaniness and sanitation along with the help and grants being provided by the government for the same.<br>
